# Version 1.1.0
## Release: March 2017
## Use github for changelogs :white_check_mark:
We should use github to quickly communicate our changelog to the public.
We would have the following benefits:
1. After each review we can directly push the markdown to the public
2. We could discuss about new features.
3. We save time

## Use github for roadmap :white_check_mark:
We should use github to quickly communicate our internal roadmap to the public.
1. After each review we can directly push the markdown to the public
2. We can add milestones to easilly communicate progress

## Use Github pages to wrap the markdown in a nice template :white_medium_small_square:
Github is too hard to use.
So why not use github pages to create a beautifull website that we can style
in our own CI? You want it? You get it :sunglasses:
- Create a branch gh-pages and add static html-template :white_check_mark:
- Automatically generate the page from markdown :white_medium_small_square:
