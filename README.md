# Can we publish roadmaps on github?

This repository is hosting a fictional roadmap.
The idea is that a programmer manages the **changelog.md**
and the **roadmap.md**

# Roadmap
If you are interested in the upcoming features of this
you can take a look at the [roadmap](/roadmap.md)

# Changelog
Take a look to find out about the newest features and bug fixes by viewing the [changelog](/changelog.md)
